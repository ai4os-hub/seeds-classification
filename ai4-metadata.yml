title: Seed species classifier
summary: Classify seeds images among 700K species.
description: |-
  Citizen science has become a powerful force for scientific inquiry, providing researchers with access to a vast array of data points while connecting non scientists to the real process of science.
  This citizen-researcher relationship creates a very interesting synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis of research projects.
  
  With this in mind, a Convolutional Neural Network has been trained to identify seed images in collaboration with [Spanish Royal Botanical Garden](http://www.rjb.csic.es).
  
  This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for seeds identification using images. The architecture used is an Xception [1] network using Keras on top of Tensorflow.
  The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with the top 5 predictions.
  As training dataset we have used a collection of images from the [Spanish Royal Botanical Garden](http://www.rjb.csic.es) which consists of around 28K images from 743 species and 493 genera.

  This service is based in the [Image Classification with Tensorflow](https://github.com/ai4os-hub/ai4os-image-classification-tf) model.
